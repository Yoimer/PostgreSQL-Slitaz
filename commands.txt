////How to Create Roles in PostgreSQL
There are a number of different ways to create roles for Postgres. It is possible to create roles from within Postgres, or from the command line.

How to Create Roles From Within PostgreSQL
The most basic way of creating new roles is from within the Postgres prompt interface.

You can create a new role with the following syntax:

CREATE ROLE new_role_name;
Let's create a new role called "demo_role":

CREATE ROLE demo_role;
CREATE ROLE
If we check the defined users again, we will get the following:

\du
                             List of roles
 Role name |                   Attributes                   | Member of 
-----------+------------------------------------------------+-----------
 demo_role | Cannot login                                   | {}
 postgres  | Superuser, Create role, Create DB, Replication | {}

The only information we are given is that the new role has no login privileges. This is okay for now.
How to Create Roles from the Command Line
An alternative method of creating roles is using the "createuser" command.

Get out of the PostgreSQL command prompt for a moment by typing:

\q
Create a role called "test_user" with the following command:

createuser test_user
Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) n
Shall the new role be allowed to create databases? (y/n) n
Shall the new role be allowed to create more new roles? (y/n) n
You will be asked a series of questions that will define some initial permissions for the new role. If you answer "n" for no to all of these prompts, you will create a user similar to the previous user we created.

We can log back into the Postgres prompt and issue the "\du" command again to see the differences between the two new roles:

psql
\du
                             List of roles
 Role name |                   Attributes                   | Member of 
-----------+------------------------------------------------+-----------
 demo_role | Cannot login                                   | {}
 postgres  | Superuser, Create role, Create DB, Replication | {}
 test_user |                                                | {}
As you can see, these commands do not produce identical results. The user created from the command line does not have "Cannot login" listed as an attribute.





///////////////////////////////////login with differents users/////////////////////////////////////////////

How to Log In as a Different User in PostgreSQL
By default, users are only allowed to login locally if the system username matches the PostgreSQL username.

We can get around this by either changing the login type, or by specifying that PostgreSQL should use the loopback network interface, which would change the connection type to remote, even though it is actually a local connection.

We will discuss the second option. First, we need to give the user we'd like to connect as a password so that we can authenticate.

Give the "test_user" a password with the following command:

\password test_user
You will be prompted to enter and confirm a password. Now, exit the PostgreSQL interface and exit back to your normal user.

\q
exit
PostgreSQL assumes that when you log in, you will be using a username that matches your operating system username, and that you will be connecting to a database with the same name as well.

This is not the case with the situation we are demonstrating, so we will need to explicitly specify the options we want to use. Use the following syntax:

psql -U user_name -d database_name -h 127.0.0.1 -W
The "user_name" should be replaced with the username we want to connect with. Similarly, the "database_name" should be the name of an existing database that you have access to.

The "-h 127.0.0.1" section is the part that specifies that we will be connecting to the local machine, but through a network interface, which allows us to authenticate even though our system username does not match. The "-W" flag tells PostgreSQL that we will be entering a password.

To log in with our "test_user" we can issue the following command:

psql -U test_user -d postgres -h 127.0.0.1 -W
Password for user test_user:
You will need to enter the password you configured. In our example, we use the database "postgres". This is the default database set up during install.

If you attempt to perform some actions in this session, you will see that you don't have the ability to do many things. This is because we did not give "test_user" permissions to administer many things.

Let's exit and get back into the administrative session:

\q
sudo su -i -u postgres
psql

///////////////////////////////my examples and own credentials//////////////////////////////

////creating role
CREATE ROLE cs50;

///creating password to role
\password cs50; (when prompting for password, my case was 12345)

///creating database (I named it, cs50example)
sudo -u postgres psql -c 'create database cs50example;'

//giving all privileges to role (cs50) on db (c50example)
sudo -u postgres psql -c 'grant all privileges on database cs50example to cs50;'

//logging with role and password
psql -U cs50 -d cs50example -h 127.0.0.1 -W

// how to invoke Flask (it is not like flask_ask)
add the FLASK_APP variable to the enviroment
including the python script where resides the code.
in linux and our case, this is like this:
export FLASK_APP=application.py
for starting the server
flask run (local connections)
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 (external conenctions)

///Heroku Installation

Standalone version
The standalone install is a simple tarball with a binary that is useful in scripted environments or where there is restricted access (non-sudo). These are sample instructions that can be modified to fit your environment. It contains its own node.js binary and will autoupdate like the above install methods.

Download the tarball and extract it so that you can access the binary from your PATH. For example:

Don’t just copy and paste! Some modification is required. (see below)

# replace REPLACE_ME_OS/REPLACE_ME_ARCH with values as noted below
$ wget https://cli-assets.heroku.com/heroku-cli/channels/stable/heroku-cli-REPLACEME_OS-REPLACE_ME_ARCH.tar.gz -O heroku.tar.gz
$ tar -xvzf heroku.tar.gz
$ mkdir -p /usr/local/lib /usr/local/bin
$ mv heroku-cli-v6.x.x-darwin-64 /usr/local/lib/heroku
$ ln -s /usr/local/lib/heroku/bin/heroku /usr/local/bin/heroku
Where REPLACE_ME_OS is one of “linux”, “darwin”, “windows” and REPLACE_ME_ARCH is one of “x64” or “x86” You also must replace “6.x.x” with the actual version.


/////////settings in linux (psql (PostgreSQL) 10.4 (Ubuntu 10.4-0ubuntu0.18.04))

/etc/init.d/postgresql start // start postgresql server

/etc/init.d/postgresql stop // start postgresql server

///////connecting to server

sudo -u postgres psql

then your connected with the postgres server shell. This looks something like this:

///// How to install PostgreSQL 10.4 on Windows

/*BEFORE INSTALLING READ THIS!*/

Download file from https://get.enterprisedb.com/postgresql/postgresql-10.7-1-windows-x64.exe

It is not recomended to install in the default location which is ProgramFiles since 
this will place your database files in the Programs directory as well.

Try C:\PostgreSQL instead

// Read all from https://www.guru99.com/download-install-postgresql.html (AGAIN DON'T LEAVE SETTINGS from default)


/********************Windows supplement

It is not recomended to install in the default location which is ProgramFiles since this will place your database files in the Progams directory as well.

If the installer fails durring the C++ 2013 runtime install, you probably already have a version of C++ 2013.
You can solve this issue by openening a cmd window in your installer directory and enter:
postgresql-10.4-1-windows-x64.exe --install_runtimes 0

Be sure to select a directory other than ProgramFiles.
The installer should by default install PostgreSQL as a service and start the service.

In order to start and stop the service you will need to be running a cmd window as administrator or open the Windows Services dialog.

You can use the following cmd commands to start and stop the PostgreSQL service.
This assumes your service was named "postgresql-x64-10"
The Windows Services dialog will have the exact name of your installed service if you need to confirm this.

net start postgresql-x64-10
net stop postgresql-x64-10
In order to use the documented pg_ctl command, you will need to set the following environmental variables in your system.
The following assumes you installed PostgreSQL in C:\PostgreSQL

Add to System variables Path:
C:\PostgreSQL\10\bin

Create the following new System variables

PGDATA
C:\PostgreSQL\10\data

PGDATABASE
postgres

PGUSER
postgres

PGPORT
5432

PGLOCALEDIR
C:\PostgreSQL\10\share\locale

If your Windows PostgreSQL service is still running, you should now be able to control the server via the documented pg_ctl commands documented here

If you open a new cmd window and type pg_ctl status you should see something like

pg_ctl: server is running (PID: 9344)
C:/PostgreSQL/10/bin/postgres.exe "-D" "C:\PostgreSQL\10\data
Be aware that these commands override your windows service commands.
This means that if you stop and start the server via the pg_ctl commands it will then be running under the cmd and not the service, therefore; if you close the current cmd window it will shut down your server.
